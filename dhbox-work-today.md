# Command Line and Nano Excercise

For this excercise, I'm trying to get familiar with the command line in DHbox. The following steps document my past commands in the terminal, and I will be using nano to process the file somehow.


    1  wget https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.19.2.1/pandoc-1.19.2.1-1-amd64.deb
    2  sudo dpkg -i pandoc-1.19.2.1-1-amd64.deb
    3  pandoc -v
    4  history
    5  history > dhbox-work-today.md
