# README

The purpose of this repo is to get familiar with git concepts for excercise 4.

4.2 Adding some more text...
    Adding more text after first commit...
    
    
Update: 

This repository contains my fail logs (or just log files) for this module. All of the command line operations for every part of the exercise have been included. Please note that some commands will be repeated from previous exercise sections, so you can just skip to the bottom of the given file for the relevant commands.


Update #2:

For whatever reason, the markdown files begin with a proper format, but the rest of the lines are stacked together. I understand that these files are barely readable, so I made a text file that contains all the logs for exercises 4.2 to 4.8. I apologize for this, and I'll split the exercise logs into txt files to avoid these issues in the future.
